A scaffold for creating Node.js applications.

## Components

Lightapp uses the CRaP framework to provide dependency injection and assist with separation of concerns.

#### Controllers

Controllers manipulate the data gathered by Providers or accessed by Resources. Your business logic will go here.

#### Providers

Providers provide a unified facade in front of one or more resources.

#### Resources

Resources provide raw data access to a single piece of technology.
